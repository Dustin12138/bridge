# BRIDGE
### This repository houses data and implementation for the BRIDGE paper under review in the the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2023. 

The dataset used in this work is from publicly available dataset of real-world Industrial processes and SCADA host execution of the same experiments from https://github.com/lordmoses/SCAPHY.

More ease of review, our code are in either in jupiter notebooks or python code. 



## SCADA Process-Control Folder: 
Here you will find our implementation of BRIDGE's statistical analysis of OPC-induced SCADA process-control constraints. You will also find intermediate trace files from our pre-processing of the original public dataset.

## PINN Folder: 
Here, you will find our implementation of BRIDGE's PINN models and anomaly detection of the industrial process scenarios in our paper. For ease of use, some can be opened in the Jupyter notebooks i n Google Colab environment. We have also uploaded the actual dataset selected from the original public data which  we used for our work.
